# Logistic Regression Classifier

This project demonstrates binary classification using logistic regression on the Breast Cancer Wisconsin dataset.

## âœ… Tasks Performed
- Loaded dataset using `sklearn.datasets`
- Standardized features with `StandardScaler`
- Trained a `LogisticRegression` model
- Evaluated with:
  - Confusion Matrix
  - Precision, Recall, F1 Score
  - ROC-AUC and ROC Curve
- Tuned classification threshold
